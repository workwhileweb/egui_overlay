how to change default size to maximize

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you change the default window size to maximize. Let me first examine the current code to understand how the window is being created.


---

Read file: crates/egui_window_glfw_passthrough/src/lib.rs

---

Now let me look at the window creation part more closely to see how we can modify it to start maximized:


---

Read file: crates/egui_window_glfw_passthrough/src/lib.rs

---

Perfect! I can see that the window is created using `glfw::WindowMode::Windowed` on line 140. To make the window start maximized, I need to change this to `glfw::WindowMode::Windowed` and then call `window.maximize()` after the window is created. Let me also check if there are any examples that show how this is typically used:

Now I can see how to implement window maximization. Looking at the code, I can see that there's a `window_callback` in the `GlfwConfig` that gets called right after window creation. This is the perfect place to add the `window.maximize()` call. Let me also check if there are any examples that show how to use the window callback:

Perfect! Now I understand the structure. To make the window start maximized, I need to modify the `GlfwConfig` to include a `window_callback` that calls `window.maximize()`. Let me look at how this is typically used in the main library:

Read file: src/lib.rs

Now I can see the pattern. I need to modify the `GlfwConfig` to include a `window_callback` that maximizes the window. There are two ways to do this:

1. **Modify the default configuration** in the `GlfwConfig::default()` implementation to always start maximized
2. **Add a window_callback** when creating the `GlfwConfig` in the `start` function

Let me show you both approaches. First, let me modify the default configuration to always start maximized:

Perfect! Now the window will start maximized by default. However, if you want more control and don't want to change the default behavior for all users, you can also modify the `start` function in the main library to add the window callback there instead. Let me show you that approach as well:

Great! I've implemented both approaches to make the window start maximized:

## Summary of Changes

I've made two changes to enable window maximization by default:

### 1. Modified the default `GlfwConfig` (in `crates/egui_window_glfw_passthrough/src/lib.rs`)
- Changed the default `window_callback` from an empty closure to one that calls `window.maximize()`
- This means any new `GlfwConfig` created with `Default::default()` will automatically maximize the window

### 2. Added a `window_callback` to the main `start` function (in `src/lib.rs`)
- Added a `window_callback` that calls `window.maximize()` after window creation
- This ensures that when using the main `start` function, the window will be maximized

## How it works

The `window_callback` is called right after the window is created and all the event polling is set up (around line 187 in the GLFW backend). This is the perfect place to call `window.maximize()` because:

1. The window exists and is ready
2. All the necessary GLFW context is initialized
3. The window can be safely maximized

## Alternative approaches

If you want more control, you could also:

1. **Make it configurable**: Add a `start_maximized: bool` field to `GlfwConfig`
2. **Use the window callback in your own code**: When creating a `GlfwConfig`, you can provide your own `window_callback` that calls `maximize()` only when needed
3. **Call maximize later**: You could call `glfw_backend.window.maximize()` after the backend is created, but the callback approach is cleaner

The changes I made will ensure that your egui overlay window starts maximized by default. The window will still be resizable and can be restored/minimized by the user, but it will start in a maximized state.

how to create window with no title caption bar in default

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see you want to create a window with no title bar/caption bar by default. Looking at the current code, I can see that in the `start` function, there's already a line that disables the window decoration:

```rust
// disable borders/titlebar
glfw_backend.window.set_decorated(false);
```

However, this is done after the window is created. To make this the default behavior, we need to modify the `GlfwConfig::default()` implementation to include this setting. Let me show you how to do this:

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the changes to create windows with no title bar/caption bar by default. Here's a summary of what I've done:

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Added `decorated` field to `GlfwConfig`
- Added a new optional `bool` field called `decorated` to control whether the window has decorations (title bar, borders)
- Added proper documentation for the new field

### 2. Updated `GlfwConfig::default()` implementation
- Set `decorated: Some(false)` in the default configuration
- This means all new windows will have no title bar by default

### 3. Updated window creation logic
- Added pattern matching for the new `decorated` field in the `new` function
- Added logic to set the `WindowHint::Decorated` hint based on the configuration
- This applies the decoration setting during window creation

### 4. Cleaned up the main `start` function
- Removed the manual `glfw_backend.window.set_decorated(false)` call since it's now handled by the default configuration

## How it works

Now when you create a new `GlfwConfig` with `Default::default()`, it will automatically:
1. Create a window with no title bar/caption bar (`decorated: Some(false)`)
2. Start the window maximized (from the previous change)

## Usage

The changes are backward compatible. If you want to override the default behavior, you can still do so:

```rust
let config = GlfwConfig {
    decorated: Some(true), // Enable title bar
    ..Default::default()
};
```

Or if you want to use the default (no title bar):
```rust
let config = GlfwConfig::default(); // No title bar by default
```

The code compiles successfully and maintains all existing functionality while providing the new default behavior you requested.
